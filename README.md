<h2>About the project</h2>

  <p>The Tic Tac Toe game is a simple two-player game where each player takes turns marking a 3x3 grid with their respective symbol (X or O). The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all nine squares are filled without any player achieving three in a row, the game is considered a draw.</p>

  <h3>Key Features</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Interactive UI: The game board is a 3x3 grid of clickable squares</li>
